Make sure you have the most updated npm packages installed before beginning. (Node.js) 
For our tutorial we will be using npm to download dependencies 

1. npm init react-app <YourAppNameWithoutCapitalLetters>  
    NOTE: If you are running in Linux make sure you write the script in Sudo mode not user mode
2. npm install react-router-dom #  Allows user to change pages
3. npm install react-boostrap bootstrap # download react-bootstrap and bootstrap # 
4. Copy the style sheet from https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/introduction  and paste them on your first index.html doc
5. npm start  # start the project.
